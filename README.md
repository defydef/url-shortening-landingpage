## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Using CSS grid to stack items on top of each other
  ![Result](./public//screenshot/Form%20-%20Transition%20stacking.png)

```html
<div
  className="grid grid-rows-[1fr_1fr_minmax(1200px, _1fr)] grid-cols-1 pt-24"
>
  <form />
  <Transition />
</div>

<!-- <form />  Form is on top of transition, and form is in between white and light grey background-->
<section className="row-start-1 row-span-2 col-start-1 z-10">
  <!-- <Transition /> -->
  <section
    className="z-0 row-start-2 row-span-2 col-start-1 bg-[var(--light-grey)] "
  ></section>
</section>
```

- Run useEffect to update keys state, so that the page immediately displays new URL

```js
const { newUrlAdded } = useLocalStorage();
const [keys, setKeys] = useState(Object.keys(localStorage));
useEffect(
  function () {
    if (newUrlAdded) setKeys(Object.keys(localStorage));
  },
  [newUrlAdded]
);
```
